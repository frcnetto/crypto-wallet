This is a challenge to create an amazing cryptocurrency wallet! So how does it work? 
  - The customer, after signing up, starts with R$ 100.000,00 (that's a lot of money!) to buy Bitcoins and Britas; 
  - Brita's currency is equivalent to dollar and will change in value as the dollar changes. The dollar rate will be consumed in the Banco Central API; 
  - Bitcoin currency will be the actual currency and will be consumed in Mercado Bitcoin API; 
  - The customer needs to be able to sell their cryptocurrencies or trade for another in any time; 
  - The customer needs to know the detailed balance for each currency; 
  - The client must have a history of financial operations.
